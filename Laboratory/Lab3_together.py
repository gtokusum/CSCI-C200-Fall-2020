    Problem Description
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In the wonderful world of Star Trek, they have a way to travel faster than light. Below is a table of the speed representation. 
    The table is from "The Star Trek Encyclopedia: A Reference Guide to the Future. Updated and Expanded Edition" by Michael Okuda 
    and Denise Okuda.
    Speed                   |    Number of times speed of light (Number represents lower bound)
    Sublight(Warp Factor 0) |    0
    Warp Factor 1           |    1
    Warp Factor 2           |    10
    Warp Factor 3           |    39
    Warp Factor 4           |    102
    Warp Factor 5           |    214
    Warp Factor 6           |    392
    Warp Factor 7           |    656
    Warp Factor 8           |    1,024
    Warp Factor 9           |    1,516
